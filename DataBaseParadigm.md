in database paradigm we only have a little to categorize

here the relation between the table and other tables that the data is being stored is important. 
The table must contain data of an individual also called record/tuple.  
the columns must be of specific datatype and column names are called attributes

number of records/tuples in a table is its cardinality
number of related columns/attributes in a table is its degree.table having 3 columns related to other tables is of degree 3
